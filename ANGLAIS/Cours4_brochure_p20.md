The document explores the case study of Plaça del Sol in Barcelona, where residents have developed a digital platform for measuring noise levels in the square and mobilising action. It examines how the Smart City model has been challenged by the citizens' initiative and how the Council's Chief Technology Officer has been promoting technological sovereignty to address concerns about citizens' data being ceded to tech vendors.

Title suggestion: "Beyond Smart City: Citizen Science in Action".

a) Ada Colau, the Mayor of Barcelona, has emphasized citizen participation and democratization in the city's digital policy. As a result, the digital policy has sought to go "beyond the Smart City", moving beyond the technocratic approach to incorporate greater citizen participation and oversight.

b) The Council of Barcelona promotes technological sovereignty to prevent the city's knowledge from being ceded to tech vendors. They aim to give citizens more control over their data and ensure that it is not used for commercial purposes.

c) Big data experts view one sensor in one square simply as a data point, but for residents, that data is connected to their lives in all its richness. They use this data to enhance their experience in the square and compare it to official noise levels.

d) Thick description refers to a method of ethnographic research that involves collecting detailed, descriptive data about a social phenomenon, including its cultural, social, and historical context. This data allows researchers to gain a deeper understanding of the phenomenon and the context in which it occurs.

e) The Smart City model is efficient but does not address the need for old-fashioned, street-level skills in community development. Therefore, investment in these skills is crucial to go beyond the Smart City model and achieve greater citizen participation and community development. Technology vendors cannot sell these skills, which must come from the community itself.
