    "# NLP & representation learning: Neural Embeddings, Text Classification\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To use statistical classifiers with text, it is first necessary to vectorize the text. In the first practical session we explored the **Bag of Word (BoW)** model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modern **state of the art** methods uses  embeddings to vectorize the text before classification in order to avoid feature engineering.\n",

    "\n",
    "By opposition to the **bag of word** model, in the modern NLP pipeline everything is **embeddings**. Instead of encoding a text as a **sparse vector** of length $D$ (size of feature dictionnary) the goal is to encode the text in a meaningful dense vector of a small size $|e| <<< |D|$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw classification pipeline is then the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "raw text ---|embedding table|-->  vectors --|Neural Net|--> class \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using a  language model:\n",
    "\n",
    "How to tokenize the text and extract a feature dictionnary is still a manual task. To directly have meaningful embeddings, it is common to use a pre-trained language model such as `word2vec` which we explore in this practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this setting, the pipeline becomes the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "      \n",
    "raw text ---|(pre-trained) Language Model|--> vectors --|classifier (or fine-tuning)|--> class \n",
